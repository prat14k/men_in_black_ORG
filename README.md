A hypothetical new concept. Made a project using concepts of oops using C++. I stored the data of the imaginary organization which manages peace and harmony in the galaxy. My project stores the data of the planets, their presidents, head planet, etc. other information. I have used OOPs concepts and file handling using C++.
